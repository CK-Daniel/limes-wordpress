# Loading Overlay Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Loading overlay appearing before addon section is visible**
   - The loading spinner was being triggered on every field change, even before all required fields were selected
   - This caused the loading to appear on a hidden container

2. **Loading overlay getting stuck**
   - When the addon container was hidden (due to incomplete fields), the loading state wasn't being cleared
   - This caused the loading spinner to remain active indefinitely

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `product-addons-integration.js`

- **Modified `showAddonLoading()`**:
  - Added visibility check before showing loading
  - Only shows loading if the addon container is visible
  - Logs message when skipping due to hidden container

- **Modified `hideAddonLoading()`**:
  - Added check for container visibility
  - Immediately clears loading state if container is hidden
  - Prevents stuck loading states

- **Added MutationObserver**:
  - Watches for form class changes that affect addon container visibility
  - Automatically cleans up loading state when container is hidden

- **Removed premature loading triggers**:
  - Removed loading triggers on color/mechanism/installation changes
  - Let the price calculation function decide when to show loading

- **Updated `updateProductPriceForAddons()`**:
  - Only shows loading when addon section is visible
  - Moved loading trigger to after validation checks

### 2. Updated `main.js`

- **Modified `showAddonLoadingOverlay()`**:
  - Added same visibility check as in product-addons-integration.js
  - Ensures consistency across both implementations

- **Modified `hideAddonLoadingOverlay()`**:
  - Added check for container visibility
  - Immediately clears loading state if container is hidden

- **Updated `recalcFinalPrice()`**:
  - Removed immediate loading trigger at start
  - Only shows loading after all validations pass
  - Loading now appears only when addon section should be visible

## How It Works Now

1. User enters dimensions â†’ No loading (addon section hidden)
2. User selects color â†’ No loading (addon section still hidden)
3. User selects mechanism â†’ No loading (addon section still hidden)
4. User selects installation â†’ Addon section becomes visible
5. Price calculation triggers â†’ Loading overlay appears on visible container
6. After 1.5 seconds minimum â†’ Loading disappears, final price shown

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Square Meter Product**:
   - Enter width/height â†’ No loading should appear
   - Select color â†’ No loading should appear
   - Select mechanism â†’ No loading should appear
   - Select installation â†’ Addon section appears with loading
   - Loading should disappear after 1.5 seconds

2. **Test Incomplete Fields**:
   - Fill all fields, then clear width
   - Addon section should hide
   - No stuck loading state

3. **Test Field Changes**:
   - Complete all fields
   - Change dimensions
   - Loading should appear briefly in visible addon section
   - Loading should not get stuck
